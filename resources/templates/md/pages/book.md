This is a gentle introduction to the field of Graphical Models, which have applications in Machine Learning, Text Mining and Natural Language Processing.

The source code for the exercises in the book are in the [Github repo](https://github.com/shark8me/Building_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_in_Python).
