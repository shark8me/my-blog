 This is the web home of Kiran Karkera. I am a Machine Learning and Data Science practitioner. I enjoy programming in the Clojure programming language, and I contribute to a couple of machine learning libraries in Clojure.

 I am the author of a book on Machine Learning, titled [Building Probabilistic Graphical Models in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/building-probabilistic-graphical-models-python).

 In my spare time, I enjoy playing the flute, and whitewater kayaking.
