Bots are right now in the [*Technology trigger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) phase of the Gartner hype cycle. Are they likely to succeed, or are they likely to fizzle out?

Lets take a look at these statistics:

* More people access the web using mobile as compared to desktops or PCs, and the trend is likely to accelerate further.

___

* A large percentage of people are yet to get online. Since most of them are will be from developing countries, they will likely access the web via a mobile phone

* This suggests that mobile Apps usage is likely to grow.
* However, app downloads are declining in developed markets and plateauing in developing markets.

In developing markets, this may be caused by users not wanting to download apps on relatively expensive data (3G) connections.

* Mobile messaging continues to be on an upward growth trajectory, being used by 3.2 billion users currently and expected to grow to 3.8 billion users by 2019, according to a report from [radicati.com](http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Instant_Messaging_Statistics_Report_2015-2019_Executive_Summary.pdf)

* Chat platforms such as WeChat have shown that buying and interacting with bots is extremely common.
* We chat has 762 million active users (as of Jan 2015) [link](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/wechat-statistics/)
* It enables its users to do such things as paying water bills, booking doctor's appointments, and getting food delivered.

It has been [pointed out](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/why-the-future-of-bots-will-be-multi-platform-67c503afaa7#.ukfaeh82v) that WeChat's success is unlikely to be duplicated easily, for a host of reasons

* China leapfrogged to start using Mobile phones directly <TODO>
* There was widespread SMS usage since call rates were high, and that translated into high chat usage once users migrated to smartphones.
* Chat platforms in other countries do not have as widespread an adoption.
* Users have a high degree of familiarity with mobile website and apps, so are unlikely to shift to using message driven means easily.

* Notes:
* Tools that combine bots with human input are getting traction. [Read about ReplyYes](http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7350110/chatbot-vinyl-records-startup-the-edit)

But data shows otherwise, app usage has declined
Growth is coming from resource poor countries where 3g data is expensive and users are unlikely to download apps.
